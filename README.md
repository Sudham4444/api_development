# API Development

## Overview

The **API Development** project is designed to demonstrate the creation and management of RESTful APIs using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). This project covers various aspects of API development, including endpoint creation, serialization, authentication, and documentation.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Create, read, update, and delete resources via API endpoints.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints using session-based authentication.
- **Serialization**: Convert complex data types to native Python datatypes that can be easily rendered into JSON.
- **Documentation**: Automatically generate and maintain API documentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Django 4.x

     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. **Install Dependencies**

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Apply Database Migrations**

     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate

6. **Create a Superuser (Optional, for admin access)**

     ```bash

7. **Run the Development Server**

     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver

8. **Access the Application**

     Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the API or http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ for the admin interface.


## Configuration

   `Authentication:` The project uses session-based authentication. You can configure it or switch to other authentication methods like JWT.
   
   `API Documentation:` Documentation is generated automatically and can be accessed at /docs/ (if configured).

## Usage
   `API Endpoints:` Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
   
   `Authentication:` Ensure that you are authenticated to access protected endpoints.

## Documentation: Visit /docs/ to see the API documentation.
   Deployment
